> before starting this lesson.
>
> This lesson also assumes some familiarity with biological concepts, including the structure of DNA, nucleotide abbreviations, and the 
> concept of genomic variation within a population. 
>
> This lesson uses data hosted on TU Delft cloud environment. Workshop participants will be given information on how
