Genome assembly is a method for re-constructing a genome from a large number of (short- or long-) DNA fragments (reads) when no reference genome is available.  
  
During this lesson you will use sequencing reads from different technologies:  
   1) short reads from Illumina  
   2) and long read from Oxford Nanopore  
  
> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes a working understanding of the bash shell. If you haven't already completed the [Shell Genomics](https://mvdb01.github.io/shell-genomics/) lesson, and aren't familiar with the bash shell, please review those materials before starting this lesson.
>
> This lesson also assumes some familiarity with biological concepts, including the structure of DNA, nucleotide abbreviations, and the concept of genomic variation within a population.
>
> This lesson uses data hosted on TU Delft cloud environment. Workshop participants will be given information on how to log-in to the cloud during the workshop.
